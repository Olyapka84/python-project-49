## Description

Hi there! This is my first test project as Iâ€™m learning Python programming :-). This project features five simple and engaging math games designed for anyone, even those who might not feel confident in math (like me!). The games include:

- Arithmetic Operations: Solve basic math problems involving addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Even Check: Determine if a given number is even.
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): Find the GCD of two numbers.
- Prime Number Check: Identify if a number is prime.
- Missing Number in a Progression: Find the missing number in an arithmetic progression.

Each game consists of three rounds. You win if you answer all three questions correctly.

    ```

3. **Build the app**:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

4. **Run the app**:

    After installation, you can run the general introduction game using the command: **brain-games**.  Each game has its own command for launching:
    - Brain Even - brain-even
    - Brain Calc - brain-calc
    - Brain GCD - brain-gcd
    - Brain Progression - brain-progression
    - Brain Prime - brain-prime

Good luck!
